 * 9.5. Using Closures
 * a closure (also lexical closure or function closure) is a function
 * together with a referencing environment for the non-local variables of that function.
 * A closure allows a function to access variables outside its immediate lexical scope
 *
 *  to create a closure in Scala, just define a function
 *  that refers to a variable thatâ€™s in the same scope as its declaration
